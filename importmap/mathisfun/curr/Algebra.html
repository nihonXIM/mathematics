    # Algebra
    ## Algebra
    ### Algebra - Definitions
    x   +   2   =   6

    ### Introduction to Algebra
    x − 2 = 4
    x = 6
    Work out what to remove to get "x = ..."
    Remove it by doing the opposite (adding is the opposite of subtracting)
    Do that to both sides

    #### What is an Equation
    _An equation says that two things are equal. It will have an equals sign "=" like this:_

    `x   +   2   =   6`

    That equation says:

    `what is on the left (x + 2) is equal to what is on the right (6)`

    So an equation is like a statement "this equals that"

    #### Parts of an Equation

    <img alt="expression-term.svg" src="../imgs/expression-term.svg"/>
    So people can talk about equations, there are names for different parts (better than saying "that thingy there"!)
    Here we have an equation that says `4x − 7 equals 5`, and all its parts:

    `4x-7=5`: `4 is coefficient`, `x is variable`, `7 and 5 constant`, `- is operator`

    A Variable is a symbol for a number we don't know yet. It is usually a letter like x or y, but can be a symbol or word.

    A number on its own is called a Constant.

    A Coefficient is a number used to multiply a variable (`4x means 4 times x, so 4 is a coefficient`)

    Variables on their own (without a number next to them) actually have a coefficient of 1 (`x is really 1x`)

    Sometimes a coefficient is a letter like a or b instead of a number:

    `Example: ax2 + bx + c`
    * `x` is a variable
    * `a` and b are coefficients
    * `c` is a constant\
    An Operator is a symbol, like +, ×, etc, that shows an operation. It tells us what to do with the value(s).


    `4x-7=5: 4x-7 `is `expression`, `4x, 7 and 5` are `terms`
    A Term is either a single number or a variable, or numbers and variables multiplied together.

    `An Expression` is `a group of terms` (the terms are separated by + or − signs)

    So now we can say things like "that expression has only two terms", or "the second term is a constant", or even "are you sure the coefficient is really 4?"

    Exponents
    The exponent (such as the 2 in x2) says how many times to use the value in a multiplication.

    `8 to the Power 2`
    Examples: Math.pow(8, 2) = 8 × 8 = 64


    y^3 = y × y × y

    y^2z = y × y × z

    Exponents make it easier to write and use many multiplications

    Example: y4z2 is easier than y × y × y × y × z × z

    Polynomial
    Example of a Polynomial: 3x2 + x − 2

    A polynomial can have constants, variables and the exponents 0, 1, 2, 3, ....

    But it never has division by a variable.

    polynomial

    Monomial, Binomial, Trinomial
    There are special names for polynomials with 1, 2 or 3 terms:

    monomial, binomial, trinomial

    Like Terms
    Like Terms are terms whose variables (and their exponents such as the 2 in x2) are the same.

    In other words, terms that are "like" each other. (Note: the coefficients can be different)

    Example:
    6xy2
    −2xy2
    (1/3)xy2
    Are all like terms because the variables are all xy2
